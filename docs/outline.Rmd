title: Aphaenogaster spp. SDM Outline

---


**Questions**

*Question 1*: How will climate change affect ant distributions of the
genus Aphaenogaster in Eastern North America?

*Question 2*: How will distribution shifts in Aphaenogaster picea,
rudis, and miamiana affect plant interactions? (specifically these
three because A. miamiana is located at the southernmost end of the
US, A.picea forages before A.rudis on different plants, so if A.rudis
is expected to replace A.picea, there’s a potential for a phenological
mismatch on both habitats….or will A. rudis cover their old habitat
plus their new habitat? Or will it be replaced by A. carolinesis?)

*Question 3*: How can ant distributional shifts help plants disperse to
higher elevation and latitudinal locations? (basically, will anything
good come out of this?)

**Hypotheses**

*Hypothesis 1*: I hypothesis that A. miamiana will contract and will be
the most vulnerable of aphaenogaster species in years 2050
and 2080. Species A. rudis, A. picea, and and A. f ulva will
experience range shifts in elevation and latitude. (Can we make maps
of future max temp/min temp/max precipitation/min precipitation before
making a super specific hypothesis?)

*Hypothesis 2*: animal-plant mutualisms between A. picea and A. rudis
will be disrupted, and displacement of A. miamiana and A. carolinensis
will result in ecological voids in seed-dispersal for plants in
southernmost U.S.

**Methods**

- Create SMDs for 6 species of Aphaenogaster ants in 2020, 2050
and 2080 under 4 RCP scenarios using two approaches (MaxEnt and
MaxLike).
- $6 \dot 3 \dot 4 \dot 2 = 128$ models total
- overlay plants with mutualistic relationships to species to assess
  possible phenological mismatches. (conservation edge here?).
- would this mean that conservationists need to look close at
  translocations?


**Notes**

We could possibly use Warren et al 2011 to compare our SDMs
(contemporary). They used Maxent so it would be interesting to see how
predictions of habitat suitability and probability of occurrence vary
among each species.
